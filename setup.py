    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    #entry_points={  # Optional
    #    'console_scripts': [
    #       'sample=sample:main',
    #    ],
    # },
